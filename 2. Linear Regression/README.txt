Problem Statement - Part I
This assignment contains two parts. Part-1 is a programming assignment (to be submitted in a Jupyter notebook) whereas part-2 includes subjective questions (to be submitted in a PDF file). 

 

Part-2 is given on the next page.

 

Assignment Part-I
A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts. 

 

They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. Essentially, the company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
How well those variables describe the price of a car
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the Americal market. 

 

Business Goal 

You are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for the management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Assignment Part-II
The following questions are the second part of the graded assignment. Please submit the answers in one PDF file. For writing normal text, please use MS Word (or similar software which can convert documents to PDF). For writing equations and drawing figures, you can write/draw them on a blank sheet of paper using a pen, click images and upload them in the same word document.

 

The final submission will be one PDF file. A sample PDF to illustrate the submission format is provided below.

 

Note: Avoid copying and pasting from anywhere and type the answers in your own words - your solution files will be tested using automatic plagiarism checkers and will attract heavy penalty if plagiarism is detected.

 

Please limit your answers to less than 600 words per question.


 

Question-1:

List down at least three main assumptions of linear regression and explain them in your own words. To explain an assumption, take an example or a specific use case to show why the assumption makes sense.


 

Question-2:

By now you have seen multiple model evaluation metrics used for regression models, such as r-squared, adjusted r-squared, RMSE, the residual plot etc.

 

In this question, you are required to explain at least three regression model evaluation metrics in your own words.

For the final model that you have built, explain each evaluation metric with its intuition (i.e. what and how it measures) and relate the intuition to its mathematical formula. You may use figures or examples to explain if needed. Limit your answer to 1000 words for this part.
Compare the advantages and disadvantages of any three evaluation metrics. If you do not think there's any advantage or disadvantage of a certain metric, mention that. Limit your answer to 1000 words for this part.
