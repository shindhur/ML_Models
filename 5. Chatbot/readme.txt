Building Chatbots with Rasa
----------------------------

If you have played with virtual assistants, such as Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa etc., you would have noticed that they are much more than a 'speech-based search engine'. Apart from searching for information (e.g. from Wikipedia, YouTube, Google etc.), they can 'talk' to you in natural language. 

Conversation, or dialogue, is a very fundamental aspect of human language, and arguably the most interesting challenge in building truly intelligent NLP systems.

A step towards building such systems is domain specific, text-based chatbots used by organisations for tasks such as booking hotels, retrieving stock market information, resolving customer queries etc.

In this module, you’ll learn to build a domain-specific chatbot using an 'open source framework for building conversational bots' - Rasa. Specifically, in this session, you’ll learn to build a restaurant search bot, though the skills you will learn can be used to make almost any domain-specific bot.
